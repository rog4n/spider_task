1. There are 4 types - DNS,HTTP,MDNS,TCP

2. There are 714 DNS queries

3. 3 types. A,AAAA,HTTPS

4. A loop back interface is a special virtual network interface used by a computer to capture and analyze network traffic generated by itself. 
   This is used for testing, diagnostics, troubleshooting.

5. 3 .txt files(decoy2.txt, encoded.txt, decoy1.txt)

6. The file "encoded.txt" contains a base64-encoded content "RkxBR3tzcGlkM3JfbmV0d29ya19tYXN0ZXJ9Cg==" which is decoded to "FLAG{spid3r_network_master}".

7. There are 2 two packets where "decoy2.txt" and "decoy1.txt" requested where they give the messages  "Nothing to see here." and "This is just a decoy.".
   This seems like an attempt to distract the analyst with decoy files.

8. Unable to find.

9. 3 HTTP GET requests are visible.

10. User-Agent: curl/8.5.0\r\n
